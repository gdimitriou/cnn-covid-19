# cnn-covid-19

# Description:
This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is being trained given an input of normal and covid-19 chest Xrays.
It can predict if a patient is positive to Covid-19, reading its chest Xray, with accuracy over 95%.
It is developed in Python (interpreter version 3.6) with the use of Tensorflow and Keras libraries.

# Dependencies:
1. Python (3.6)
2. Tensorflow (2.1.0)
3. Keras (2.3.1)
4. Pillow (7.1.1)
5. matplotlib (3.2.1)
6. np (1.0.2)
7. scikit-learn (0.22.2.post)
8. numpy (1.18.2)
9. os

# Instructions to run the program:
1. Clone the project from: https://github.com/gdimitriou/cnn-covid-19.git
2. Import it to your favorite IDE
3. Download the dependencies
4. Run the CnnCovid19.py

# Expecting output:
1. Console output:
    a. Number of train and validation images
    b. The stages of the CNN
    c. Process of train the model (acc, loss, val. acc, val. loss)
    d. Confusion matrix
    e. Classification report

2. Plots:
    a. Plot 5 random images from train set
    b. Plot graph of acc, loss, val. acc, val. loss
